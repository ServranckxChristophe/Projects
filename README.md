# Projects
Respository containing some of the projects I worked on (master thesis, personnal work, etc.)

Summary :

- Master Thesis : a part of the scripts I used during my master thesis
- Fluid dynamics : some of the project, in fluid dynamics, I worked on during my university studies
  * Stokes flow : solving the stokes flow in a square cavity with a lid
  * Reaction-diffusion model : simulation of the interaction of two chimical species that react and diffuse with each other
  * Sods Shock Tube : calculation of the pressure, density and velocity of a compressible gas through a shock tube at a time following the diaphragm rupture initially containing the gaz
  * Traffic Flow : modelisation and description of traffic flow on a single-lane roadway
